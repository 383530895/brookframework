##INTRODUCTION

**[Brook](http://brookframework.org)** is perfect [Free Pascal](http://freepascal.org/) framework for your web applications. It's pure Pascal. You don't need to leave your prefered programming language.<br>
It's complete: actions simple or configurable for database access, advanced routing features, wizard for [Lazarus](http://lazarus.freepascal.org), support to internationalization, high compatibility with [JSON](http://json.org) structures, eazy and elegant [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) implementation, plugins for varied necessities, brokers extensible and decoupled... In fact, youhave several reasons to adopt Brook as your web development framework.

##FEATURES

* **Advanced routes management** - Actions are performed by means of routes. Applications replies to requests passing information by routes. This work could envolve a bunch of boring tests, but Brook knows how to receive a request and choose the correct URL and the correct method to reply it. After Brook, you have a shorter and friendly code to handle your routes.
* **Integrated data persistance** - Brook is also competent to find good partners. Brook offers a table object where data can be handled. Less instanciations, less coding, with a elegant syntax. These are advantages of Brook, but in this case, it's a special virtue of [Greyhound](https://github.com/mdbs99/Greyhound), the friend project partner responsible to handle with databases. Under the Brook scope, there are other database layers indicated for specific usages but,  for most cases, Greyhound is the indicated one.
* **JSON native support** - [JSON](http://json.org) structures are largely used by JavaScript. JSON is widespred in the web when the subject is the data exchanging. You will really regard a good idea to have JSON support.
* **REST architecture support** - If you didn't come from web development world, you won't understand the power of [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). REST is not a software component or a tool kit, REST is an idea. An idea able to simplify and standardize data requests and replies. Brook is powerful even if you don't use REST. But you will want to use it.
* **Lazarus wizards for instalation and usage** - No, Brook didn't forget [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org) users. With lazarus, the development is easier; with the Brook wizards, only a few clicks is required to start and configure your Brook projects.
* **Plugins for varied necessities** - In the full package of Brook, it's all included: mail sending, HTTP utilities, templating, algebric expressions processing, RSS reading and writing and much more. You can see the whole list of plugins [here](https://github.com/silvioprog).
